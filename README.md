# Robin (Karel Hermine) Smeets

## Welcome to My GitHub Page!

[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc) ðŸ‘‹! I'm Robin, an applied math PhD student at [the Korteweg-de Vries Institute of the University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/m/r.k.h.smeets/r.k.h.smeets.html). Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share my projects and the occasional fun fact.

### Research Interests

I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of numerical methods for PDEs and machine learning, with a particular focus on least square methods. My research aims to explore novel ways of numerically solving (potentially high-dimensional) PDEs, leveraging machine learning techniques to solve problems which are computationally difficult for classical methods (e.g. FEM, FD, etc.). I'm always open to discussing related topics, so feel free to reach out!

### Current Projects

#### Least squares solvers for PDEs: inhomogeneous boundary conditions, and application with machine learning

- **Description:** This paper introduces new well-posed least squares formulations for solving certain classes of PDEs (including the Poisson equation). Furthermore, it covers proofs and ways of implemeting these formulation for FEM and machine learning methods.
- **Technologies Used:** Python and PyTorch.
- **Status:** Writing first draft of paper.
- **Github Repository:** Will be made public after submitting.
- **Paper:** Will be added when on arXiv.
- **Co-authors/Contributors:** [Harald Monsuur](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/m/o/h.monsuur/h.monsuur.html) and [Rob Stevenson](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.p.stevenson/).

### Past Projects

#### Robust time-discretisation and linearisation schemes for singular and degenerate evolution systems modelling biofilm growth

- **Description:** This paper investigates a robust and structure-preserving time-discretisation and linearisation schemes for singular and degenerate evolution systems arising in mathematical models for biofilm growth. The newly introduced numerical scheme has been implemented in Python using FEniCSx to validate the scheme.
- **Technologies Used:** Python and FEniCSx.
- **Status:** Preprint submitted to journal.
